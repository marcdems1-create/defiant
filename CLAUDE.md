# DEFIANT — Claude Session Memory

> Read this before touching anything in this repo.

## What this is

**Defiant is a non-custodial DeFi yield interface for a Canadian audience.** Connect your
own wallet, compare live on-chain yield across Aave v3, Lido, and Yearn v3, deposit or
withdraw with transactions you sign yourself. The app never holds funds — no pooled
contract, no admin key, no custody. See `README.md` for the full rationale and regulatory
framing; the short version: custody is what turns this into a heavily-regulated Canadian
financial product, so custody is the thing this build refuses to add.

**Not called a "savings app" anywhere in the product.** DeFi yield is not deposit-insured
and carries real smart-contract/market/liquidity risk. Calling it "savings" would misstate
that to a consumer audience. If a future session is asked to rebrand toward "savings"
language, flag the regulatory/consumer-protection implication first — don't just do it.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Never add a code path where the app itself holds, pools, or moves user funds.** Every
   value-moving transaction (approve, supply, deposit, withdraw, submit, redeem, claim) must
   be built client-side and signed by the connected wallet. No relayer, no meta-transaction
   sponsor wallet, no server-side signer holding user assets — that's the entire non-custodial
   premise and it's the whole reason this doesn't need FINTRAC/CSA registration on day one.
2. **Never approve `type(uint256).max` / unbounded allowances.** Every ERC-20 `approve` call
   scopes to the exact amount being deposited. See `components/DepositWithdrawModal.tsx`.
3. **Never fabricate an APY.** If a protocol's API/on-chain read doesn't return a value we can
   parse with confidence, skip that opportunity — don't show a guessed or stale number as if
   it were live. `lib/protocols/yearn.ts` and `lib/protocols/lido.ts` both return `null`/`[]`
   on parse failure rather than falling back to a hardcoded default.
4. **Testnet is the default network mode.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_MODE=mainnet` is an explicit
   opt-in (`.env.local`), not something to flip casually while iterating. Real transactions on
   Aave/Lido/Yearn move real funds.
5. **Contract addresses are not assumed — they're read from official sources and cited.**
   `lib/config/addresses.ts` has a comment block naming exactly where each address came from
   and when it was last verified. If you add a new chain/asset, verify against
   [bgd-labs/aave-address-book](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-address-book) or
   [lidofinance/docs](https://github.com/lidofinance/docs) — don't paste an address from
   memory or an unverified search result into financial code.

## ⛔ RainbowKit/wagmi config must stay lazy — do not regress

`lib/wagmi.ts` exports `getWagmiConfig()`, a lazy singleton — **not** an eagerly-evaluated
`export const wagmiConfig = getDefaultConfig(...)`. This is load-bearing, not a style choice.

RainbowKit's `getDefaultConfig()` constructs every default wallet connector (WalletConnect,
MetaMask SDK, Coinbase Smart Wallet) and touches browser-only APIs (`indexedDB`, `WebSocket`)
at call time. If it runs at **module-import time** (a top-level `const`), it crashes Next's
Node-side "Collecting page data" build step — `TypeError: (0 , x.y) is not a function` — for
*any* page that transitively imports the file, even client components wrapped in
`next/dynamic(..., { ssr: false })`. `ssr:false` only skips rendering; Next still has to
`require()` the module graph in Node to collect page metadata, and that require alone was
enough to execute `getDefaultConfig()` and crash.

Rules:
- `chains`, `NETWORK_MODE`, `SupportedChainId` in `lib/wagmi.ts` are safe to import anywhere
  (no RainbowKit dependency) — keep it that way.
- Only ever call `getWagmiConfig()` from code that executes in the browser: inside
  `app/providers.tsx` (itself loaded via `dynamic(() => import('./providers'), { ssr: false })`
  in `app/layout.tsx`), or inside a client event handler (`components/DepositWithdrawModal.tsx`,
  `components/LidoWithdrawalRequests.tsx`). Never at module scope.
- `ConnectButton` from `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` is never imported directly — use
  `components/ConnectButtonClient.tsx`, which isolates it behind its own
  `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })` so no page's static import graph pulls RainbowKit into a
  server-evaluated chunk.
- If a future change reintroduces `export const wagmiConfig = getDefaultConfig(...)` at
  module scope, `npm run build` will fail on `/opportunities` (or wherever imports it) with
  the exact error above. Re-apply the lazy-singleton pattern rather than special-casing routes.

## Current state (2026-08-13, initial build)

Scaffolded end-to-end: wallet connect (RainbowKit/wagmi), live opportunity aggregation across
Aave v3 + Lido + Yearn v3 (Ethereum/Base/Arbitrum where each protocol is deployed), a
portfolio dashboard reading live on-chain balances, and a full deposit/withdraw transaction
flow per protocol (including Lido's async request-then-claim withdrawal queue).
`npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` both pass clean. Nothing has been run against a live
testnet yet — this was built, typechecked, and build-verified but not transaction-tested (no
browser, no real wallet, no RPC in this environment). **Before trusting any of the
transaction flows with real value, run each deposit/withdraw path end-to-end on the default
testnet config first.**

Known gaps, detailed in `README.md`'s "Known simplifications" section:
- Yearn's yDaemon API response shape (`apr.forwardAPR.netAPR` etc.) is unverified against the
  live endpoint — this sandbox's network policy blocked reaching `ydaemon.yearn.fi` while
  building. Smoke-test on first real run.
- Lido withdrawal-queue allowance isn't read live (always submits approve) — harmless, just
  an extra signature on repeat withdrawals.
- USDC-only for Aave/Yearn. No risk scoring, no TVL display, no slippage handling (not
  applicable yet — nothing here routes through a DEX).

## What to build next (not started, in rough priority order)

1. Run the full deposit → withdraw cycle on testnet for all three protocols, fix whatever
   breaks. This has never been transaction-tested against a live RPC.
2. Smoke-test the Yearn API integration specifically — verify `apr.forwardAPR.netAPR` is the
   right field before trusting displayed Yearn APYs.
3. Real compliance review before any mainnet/public launch — see README's regulatory section.
   Do not add Canadian-specific marketing copy, "safe", "guaranteed", or FDIC/CDIC-adjacent
   language anywhere without that review happening first.
4. Risk context per opportunity (protocol TVL, audit status, Aave utilization rate) — an APY
   number with zero risk context is a half-honest product.

## Rules Claude must follow every session

1. Read this file before making changes.
2. Non-custodial architecture is load-bearing, not a preference — see Non-negotiables #1.
3. Verify any new contract address against an official source before writing it into
   `lib/config/addresses.ts`. Cite the source in a comment.
4. Default to testnet in any new config; require an explicit, visible signal before code
   assumes mainnet.
5. `npm run typecheck` before considering a change done.
